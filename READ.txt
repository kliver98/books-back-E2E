Like this workshop or homework it's about E2E Testing, I did not modify backend
but there is a lot of bugs. For instance, when updating the user, behind escenes, can change
id and creates a new book instead of showing error that book doesn't exist.
This is why I put some comments on code to show some assertions I made.
One interesting test I tried to do, axios did not allow me, was changing Origin in headers from
another url. This way backend should not allow me to access, but only worked changing the header in postman.
